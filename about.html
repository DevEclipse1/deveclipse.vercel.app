    <h1 style="margin: 100px;"><strong>ABOUT</strong></h1>
    <strong><p style="margin: 100px;">My nickname is deveclipse, and I love computers and electronics. From building custom PCs to exploring the latest in microcontroller technology, my passion drives me to experiment with various projects. I enjoy coding in C++ for developing efficient algorithms and game cheats, while I use C# for creating immersive games in Unity. I also make Roblox games, bringing my ideas to life in a fun and interactive way. Python is my go-to for general programming tasks, allowing me to automate processes and dive into data analysis. I'm always eager to learn more and push the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world.</p></strong>
